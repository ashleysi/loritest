                <h1> Hi there!</h1>
                <p> 
					I am Lori Hubbard, a wife, a mom, a sister and a daughter of a hootenanny-er from way back. 
					I grew up listening to all kinds of music, hearing music being played by my dad and brother 
					and at 14 started playing guitar. In college I played small coffee houses and then played in bars 
					in Montauk as a twenty something year old. I met my husband Jim because we were both singers and guitar p
					layers, and we went on to not only perform together but to host countless house “jams” in our living room. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Life got busy having three kids and a health food store with my sister, so most of my playing was just in 
					the living room when the kids were little. I started going into their classrooms to sing when they started 
					preschool and continued until they were in elementary school. As my parents started getting older I began 
					typing up lyrics for them so that THEY could sing along in the living room jams. And now that everyone is 
					grown up I am a full time musician- playing gigs, writing music and working all week in preschools and libraries.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I’m not holding a guitar or jumping around with kids you can find me cooking, riding a mule, hiking, doing yoga 
					or maybe getting lost in a jig saw puzzle. And laughing. Because there is always something to laugh about!
